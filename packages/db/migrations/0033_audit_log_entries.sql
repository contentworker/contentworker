-- 0033_audit_log_entries: which entries each audit row is about, for an entry's activity. Mirrors
-- `audit_log_entries` in packages/db/src/schema.ts.
--
-- A row is about an entry when it targets it (`target_type` 'entry'), and when its `detail` names
-- it: an approved review, a duplicate's new entry, a workflow run's undo each target something
-- else and save entries. Finding the second kind in `audit_log` itself means reading every row's
-- JSON in the space, and the log only grows; here it is one range of an index, ending in (`at`,
-- `audit_id`), the listing's keyset order, so a page has no sort. A row names at most 20 entries
-- (`MAX_AUDIT_DETAIL_ENTRIES`), so this holds at most 21 rows for each of it.
--
-- A trigger rather than the store, for the reason 0030 gives: CI migrates before it deploys and a
-- rollback leaves the migration in place, so code that has never heard of this table appends audit
-- rows. Here every writer's row is indexed, in the statement that appends it, and the store's own
-- insert names neither the table nor the rule. `environment_id` is the row's: a row without one
-- (a promotion's, which spans two) is about no environment's entry. Audit history is never
-- deleted, so neither is this; deleting an environment leaves both.
--
-- Rows already written are indexed below. Rows from before 0032 have no `detail`, so only their
-- target counts, and rows from before 0031 that came through REST or MCP have no `target_type`:
-- they don't appear in an entry's activity (the audit log's `targetId` filter still finds them).
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `audit_log_entries` (
  `audit_id` text NOT NULL,
  `space_id` text NOT NULL,
  `environment_id` text,
  `entry_id` text NOT NULL,

-- The target, then each entry `detail` names that isn't the target. `detail` is JSON the store
-- wrote; one that isn't, or an element that isn't an object with a text `entryId` (a hand-written
-- row), names nothing rather than failing the append. An element is read through its path in the
-- whole document (`fullkey`), never as JSON of its own: a string element's value is bare text, and
-- reading that as JSON throws. OR IGNORE: a row's entries are distinct already, so it only ever
-- ignores a re-run.
