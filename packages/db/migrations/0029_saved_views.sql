-- 0029_saved_views: saved views of the entries list. Mirrors `saved_views` in
-- packages/db/src/schema.ts.
--
-- A new table, so the code already deployed never reads or writes it, and nothing is backfilled.
-- Space-scoped, not per environment: a view is how people work through the content, not content,
-- so every environment of the space shows the same views and none rides a snapshot or a clone.

-- One row per view. `query` is the structured query (filters, where tree, order, search, kept
-- extra keys) as JSON, never a query string; `columns` is a JSON list or NULL for the default.
-- `created_by` is the creator as the audit trail names them, and a personal view's owner.
-- `revision` is the compare-and-set every save rides with.
