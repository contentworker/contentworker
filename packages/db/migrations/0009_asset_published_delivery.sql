-- 0009_asset_published_delivery: the published asset snapshot carries what Delivery and the media
-- Worker build its URLs from, so neither reads the draft row: the file `version` the URLs carry,
-- the `r2_key` of its bytes, its `kind` (for the delivery list's filter) and its `rights` (credit,
-- license, expiry). Mirrors `assetPublished` in packages/db/src/schema.ts.
--
-- Every column is nullable or has a constant default, so the code already deployed keeps writing
-- snapshots; the new code writes them all on every publish. Existing snapshots are backfilled
-- from their asset's row, which until replacing files ships holds the same file. A key that is
-- NULL there (0007 couldn't decode it) stays NULL, and the code falls back to the asset's own key
-- prefix.
