-- 0034_entry_position: each entry's place in its content type's manual order. Mirrors `entries`
-- and `entry_published` in packages/db/src/schema.ts.
--
-- `position` is a key that sorts by plain comparison (`positionBetween` in
-- packages/domain/src/entry/position.ts). Nullable, no backfill: an entry with none sorts by its
-- id, which uses the same characters and, minted as a UUIDv7, sorts by creation time. So every type
-- starts in creation order and a new entry lands at the end without anything writing a key; only a
-- move writes one. The order is read as `COALESCE(position, id)`, which the two indexes below hold,
-- ending in the id that breaks ties, so an ordered list is one index range with no sort.
--
-- `entry_published` keeps its own copy, so Delivery orders published rows without a join. Triggers
-- keep it, for the reason 0030 gives: CI migrates before it deploys and a rollback leaves the
-- migration in place, so code that has never heard of this column publishes entries. A copy made
-- only by new code would go missing the moment old code published one. Here every writer gets the
-- same result: a first publish copies the key, and a move copies it to a published row. A
-- republish is an upsert that never names the column, so the published row keeps it. The triggers
-- fire on `position` alone, which only a move writes, and `changes()` doesn't count a trigger's
-- writes, so the store's guards still hold.
