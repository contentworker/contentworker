-- 0020_menus: navigation menus, as delivery data. Mirrors `menus` in packages/db/src/schema.ts.
--
-- A new table, so the code already deployed never reads or writes it, and nothing is backfilled.
-- Environment-scoped (the environment purge clears it, snapshots and clones carry it).

-- One row per menu: its items are a JSON tree (at most MAX_MENU_ITEMS items, MAX_MENU_DEPTH deep),
-- written whole. `revision` is the compare-and-set every save rides with, so two people saving the
-- same menu can't both win. Delivery reads a menu by handle and, in the same batch, the published
-- entries and terms its items name (json_tree over `items`).
