 * Environment import and clone as durable jobs.

 * Replaying a snapshot writes every entry through the use-cases, which for an environment of any
 * size is far more than one request can hold (CPU, and the request's lifetime). So the request
 * does what must be synchronous: every check (`prepareSnapshotImport`, so a bad snapshot is
 * refused before anything is written), then the content model, taxonomy and workflows, which are
 * small and which everything else depends on. The assets and entries are staged in object storage
 * in chunks and written by the bulk-job machinery, which brings resumability, cancellation, the
 * stall sweep and a per-item report.
 *
 * Two jobs, chained. The first creates asset records and entries as drafts. Publishing waits for
 * it to finish, because publishing an entry needs every entry and asset it links to to exist, and
 * chunks run concurrently. When the first job completes, the second (publish what was published,
 * then lay changed entries' drafts on top) starts in the same write that finalizes the first.
