 * content types, the rendition presets) are read once and remembered for the rest of it: a
 * GraphQL request that loaded them to build its schema doesn't load them again per field.
 *
 * Make one per request and drop it with the request: nothing here expires, so it must never be
 * held across requests (a long-lived one would serve a stale config). Remembered parts are keyed
 * by scope, so one request reading two scopes never mixes their answers. Entries and assets are
 * never remembered: each read asks for its own.
