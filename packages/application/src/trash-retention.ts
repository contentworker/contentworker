 * turns going first, hour by hour; first pages are read only until they hold the run's budget,
 * which is then shared evenly between the environments that have expired trash.
 *
 * Fair to what is behind a refusal: a refused entry (a plugin's legal hold, a race) uses no purge
 * slot, and each environment resumes where its last run stopped (a keyset cursor stored on the
 * environment), so entries held for good never stop the ones behind them. Once an environment's
 * expired trash has been read to its end, the next run starts from the oldest again and retries
 * what was refused. Idempotent: a re-run starts from what is left.
