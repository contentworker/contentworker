/**
 * Telling someone when a cron sweep goes stale.
 *
 * The heartbeat (`scheduler-health.ts`) shows staleness to whoever asks; this tells the deployment's
 * alert recipients once per stale episode, and once more when it recovers. The cron evaluates
 * it at the end of every tick (`alertOnSchedulerTick`, after the heartbeat write), so it adds no
 * trigger and no writer: the cron is already the scheduler tables' only writer, and it writes the
 * alert state only when an episode opens, closes or a notice is sent.
 *
 * A sweep is stale once it has gone {@link schedulerJobStaleAfterMs} without a success: two of its
 * runs for an hourly or daily sweep, five minutes for the every-minute ones (the `/health`
 * window). A sweep that keeps failing is stale the same way; one that fails once and then
 * succeeds is not.
 *
 * The cron can't report its own death: when it stops, nothing here runs. That is the external
 * uptime check's job, against the api's `/health/scheduler` (503 while stale). What the cron can
 * do is say so when it comes back: a tick that finds the previous one more than five minutes old
 * sends a "resumed" notice, closing the outage the uptime check opened.
 *
 * State lives in two deployment settings: the recipients (`scheduler-alerts`, set by a deployment
 * administrator) and the episodes (`scheduler-alerts:state`, the cron's). Each write is a
 * compare-and-set, so two overlapping ticks never both open, or both send, the same notice.
