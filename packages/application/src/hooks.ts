/**
 * The use-case side of the hook seam.
 *
 * Call sites get one line and no branching, and the rules that matter live here
 * rather than being restated (and eventually diverging) at five different
 * points on the write path:
 *
 * - No dispatcher configured means no cost at all — not an empty dispatch.
 * - A veto raises, so a caller can never accidentally continue past a refusal
 *   by forgetting to check a return value.
 * - A veto carrying field issues becomes a ValidationError, so a hook's
 *   complaint about a field reaches the editor exactly like a built-in one.
 *   Everything else becomes a HookRejectedError naming the hook, so an editor
 *   can tell "the CMS rejected this" from "your integration rejected this".
