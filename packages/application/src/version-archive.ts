/**
 * Moving superseded entry version bodies out of D1.
 *
 * Version bodies are most of what an append-heavy space stores, and a D1 database holds at most
 * 10 GB. Only two versions of an entry are read on hot paths: the current one (joined into every
 * entry read) and the published one (diffed on every publish). Every other version is read only
 * by the history views, so its body can live in object storage. Versions are immutable and an
 * entry's current version only ever increases, so a version that is superseded stays superseded.
 *
 * The sweep writes each body to object storage first and only then drops it from D1, under a
 * condition that it is still there: a crash between the two leaves the body in D1 (and the sweep
 * tries again), and a read racing the sweep finds the body in one place or the other.
