 * Multipart uploads, for files past what one signed PUT takes (100 MiB, the Workers request-body
 * cap). The api starts an R2 multipart upload for a new draft, signs a URL per part (each bound to
 * its upload, number and exact length), and completes it with the parts' etags; completing starts
 * ingest exactly as a finished single PUT does. The key is minted the same way as a single PUT's
 * ({@link prepareUploadDraft}), so it obeys the same rules.
 *
 * A file replacement past one PUT goes the same way ({@link startMultipartAssetFileReplacement}):
 * its upload is for the next version's key, and completing it commits that version in the same
 * unit a single-PUT replacement's commit uses. Which kind an upload is, its key says: version 1 is
 * a new asset's, any later one a replacement's.
 *
 * An upload left unfinished is aborted by the hourly sweep a day on ({@link
 * sweepAbandonedMultipartUploads}), and by the bucket's lifecycle rule after that; its draft goes
 * with the abandoned-upload sweep.
