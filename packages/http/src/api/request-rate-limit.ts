/**
 * Per-client request-rate limiting for the whole API surface.
 *
 * This is deliberately separate from {@link ./auth-rate-limit.js}: that one
 * budgets *failed authentication attempts* per IP (a credential-stuffing
 * guard), while this one budgets *total request volume* per credential (an
 * abuse/cost guard for publicly reachable deployments). A caller with a valid
 * key sails through the auth limiter no matter how fast it hammers the API.
 *
 * Requests are bucketed into three classes with independent budgets, because
 * their marginal cost differs by orders of magnitude:
 *   - `read`  — delivery/preview reads; usually served from cache.
 *   - `write` — mutations; a D1 unit of work plus an outbox append.
 *   - `ai`    — routes that call a model or an embeddings provider; real money.
 *
 * The in-process implementation below serves tests and bare `createApp`
 * callers. The Worker injects Cloudflare's `ratelimit` binding through the same
 * interface (see src/rate-limit.ts).
