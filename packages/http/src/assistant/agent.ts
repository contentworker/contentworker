/**
 * The admin's assistant: one Durable Object per person, named for them, hosted by the engine
 * (which supplies the wiring: `wire` and `personNow`). Built on AIChatAgent, so the conversation
 * lives in the object's SQLite and a reply keeps streaming if the tab goes away.
 *
 * Its tools are MCP tools, run in-process as the person (./tools.ts). Two ways in:
 * - a model turn (`onChatMessage`): the model is offered `ASSISTANT_TOOLS`; reads run directly,
 *   and every write it proposes waits for the person's confirm (`needsApproval`);
 * - a page's edit (`act`, then `resolve` for an action that needs a confirm): the exact tool call,
 *   no model, joining the conversation as a tool call of its own.
 *
 * Who: the web Worker signs the socket's principal; this object checks the signature itself when
 * the socket opens and keeps who it names per connection. Every frame a socket sends, and every
 * turn, `act` and `resolve`, first checks that person again as they are now (enabled, their
 * session live); a socket whose person no longer is is closed, and so is every other one before
 * anything is broadcast. Their access to the page's space is resolved afresh for each call.
 *
 * What a client sends is held to what this object made: the chat protocol lets a client save
 * messages, so only new user messages are taken from it (stored ones are kept as stored), and a
 * tool call runs only if the model really emitted it (`model:` records) or `act` made it
 * (`direct:` records), with the input it was made with.
