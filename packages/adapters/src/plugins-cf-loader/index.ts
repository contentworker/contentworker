/**
 * Plugin runtime backed by Cloudflare's Worker Loader.
 *
 * Each plugin runs in its own dynamic Worker: a separate v8 isolate with no
 * ambient authority. What it can do is exactly what it is handed, and what it
 * is handed is decided here.
 *
 * Three properties were verified against a real workerd before this was
 * written, rather than assumed:
 *
 * 1. `globalOutbound: null` genuinely severs the isolate from the network —
 *    `fetch()` inside it throws rather than escaping. It stays severed even for
 *    a plugin granted `network:request`: that capability is a method handed in
 *    as an RPC argument, checked against the allowlist host-side, so there is
 *    no ambient network to bypass it with. Filtering the isolate's own outbound
 *    instead would need a per-plugin `Fetcher` for `globalOutbound`, which the
 *    runtime does not offer — a dynamically-loaded worker cannot be passed
 *    (`DataCloneError`, by design) and a parent entrypoint cannot be
 *    constructed per plugin. Both were tried against a real workerd.
 * 2. Capabilities cannot be passed as load-time `env` (RPC references only
 *    serialize *for* RPC), so they are passed as arguments on the RPC call.
 *    That is the better shape anyway: a warm isolate cannot retain authority
 *    granted for an earlier invocation.
 * 3. An ungranted capability carries no authority inside the sandbox. This
 *    adapter re-derives what the isolate receives from the invocation's grant
 *    (`gateCapabilities`): only methods listed for a granted capability in
 *    `PLUGIN_CAPABILITY_METHODS` are bound to host code; every other listed
 *    method is an inert stand-in that holds no reference to anything and
 *    refuses with a `capability_denied` error, reported through `onDenied`;
 *    anything the host passed that the map does not list is dropped. Deny by
 *    default, even against a host that handed over too much.
