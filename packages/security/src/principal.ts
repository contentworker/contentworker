 * The api believes the header only when it is signed with the `PRINCIPAL_KEY` secret both Workers
 * hold, names the exact path it was sent to, and has not expired (60 seconds after it was issued).
 * Whatever a caller sent in the header is always replaced by the web Worker; a request that reaches
 * the api with a bearer token carries no principal at all.
 *
 * Format: `base64url(JSON payload)` `.` `base64url(HMAC-SHA256(key, <the base64url payload>))`,
 * with payload `{ sub, email, name, role, sid?, iat, exp, path }`; `iat` and `exp` are Unix seconds.
 *
 * Dependency-free (Web Crypto only), so it runs unchanged in Workers, Node and the browser.
