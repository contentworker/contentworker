/*
 * Ledger's AI loader: a model at work, drawn as content being composed. An icon is a list of
 * marks in a 24-unit box (strokes, and filled blocks), and each mark writes itself in reading
 * order (a stroke draws along its path, a block is revealed from its leading edge), holds, then is
 * taken away in the same order while the icon fades, the way a line of type is set and cleared. Nothing falls,
 * spins or sparkles: the default icon is ContentWorker's own mark (a page: frame, title block,
 * two lines of body), so the thing the agent is making is the loader itself.
 *
 * The look and timing are `.cw-compose` in the admin's app.css: one 2.8s cycle, each mark offset
 * by its own `at`. A sequence plays one icon per cycle. Where motion is reduced, the icon is drawn
 * whole and holds still, and a sequence holds on its first icon. The loader is decoration
 * (`aria-hidden`); the line beside it says what is happening, unless `label` makes it the status.
