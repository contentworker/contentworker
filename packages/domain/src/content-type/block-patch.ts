/**
 * Key-addressed edits to a blocks field: insert, update, move, remove and duplicate one block,
 * addressed by its `_key` rather than its position, so an agent (or a live-preview client) can
 * change one block of a long page without resending the whole field, and without its edit landing
 * on the wrong block when someone reordered the page in between.
 *
 * Every op names a top-level blocks field and one locale of it; its keys are looked up in that
 * field's tree in that locale. A block's children are the blocks fields its variant declares
 * directly (its *slots*); blocks under a plain component or repeater inside a block are carried
 * along but not addressable here.
 *
 * `_key` is unique per array, not per tree: validation refuses two blocks sharing a key in one
 * field value at one level, but the same key at two depths (a section pasted inside itself with
 * its keys) is stored without complaint. Keys minted here are UUIDv7 and never collide, but a
 * caller-supplied one can, so an op that addresses a key held by more than one block in the tree
 * is refused as ambiguous rather than guessed at.
 *
 * A patch is all-or-nothing: the ops run in order against the result of the ones before, and the
 * first that can't apply refuses the whole patch with issues naming its index. Pure — the
 * use-case reads, saves and mints the ids.
