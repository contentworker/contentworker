/**
 * What a write changed in an entry, as an audit row keeps it: where, never what. It is read off the
 * deterministic diff (`diffEntryFields`, structure only: this runs on every save) by walking the
 * content model, so a path can only ever be
 * made of model api ids. Nothing a writer typed reaches it: a JSON field, a `Seo` value and rich
 * text stop at the field, a block's `_key` is left out (a save keeps the key it was sent), a nested
 * key the model doesn't declare reports its parent, and a locale key counts only if the space has
 * that locale (a localized field stores whatever keys it is sent).
