name: building-on-contentworker
description: Build a website, app or service that reads and writes content in ContentWorker, a headless CMS. Use when choosing a ContentWorker SDK, reading published content (Delivery) or drafts (Preview), writing through the Management API, keeping reads consistent after a write, generating TypeScript types from the content model, rendering rich text (including embeds), or deciding how to cache.

# Building on ContentWorker

ContentWorker serves content as typed JSON, never HTML. Your code picks an API by what it needs,
types itself from the content model, and renders rich text from a node tree.

## Pick the API and the key

| You need                         | API and origin                        | Key (kind)          | SDK                                             |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Published content on a live site | Delivery, `https://cdn.<workspace>`   | Delivery (`cda`)    | `@contentworker/sdk` (or `/react`, `/vue`, `/edge`) |
| Drafts on a staging site         | Preview, `https://api.<workspace>`    | Preview (`cpa`)     | `@contentworker/sdk` with `preview: true`  |
| Writes: create, update, publish  | Management, `https://api.<workspace>` | Management (`cma`)  | `@contentworker/sdk/management` (server only)   |

Only a Delivery key may ship to a browser or app. Preview and Management keys stay on a server.
Delivery is cached at the edge; Preview and Management are not.

## Read

```ts
import { createDeliveryClient } from '@contentworker/sdk';

const client = createDeliveryClient({
  baseUrl: 'https://cdn.your-workspace.contentworker.app',
  space: 'your-space',
  environment: 'main',
  token: process.env.CONTENTWORKER_CDA_TOKEN!,
});

const article = await client.getEntry(id, { locale: 'en-US', include: 1 });
const latest = await client.query().contentType('article').locale('en-US').order('-sys.publishedAt').limit(10).fetch();
```

- `include` (0 to 10) embeds linked entries and assets, inside rich text too; without it a link
  stays `{ id, linkType }`.
- Pass `locale` to get plain values with the fallback chain applied; without it each field is
  keyed by locale.
- Lists return `{ items, total }` where `total` counts this page: page with `limit` (at most 100)
  and `skip` until a page comes back short.
- `client.search(text)` is semantic search; `client.getAsset` and `client.iterateAssets` read
  delivered assets, and `imageProps` turns one into `<img>` attributes.
- React: `ContentworkerProvider`, `useEntry`, `useEntries`, `Image` from `@contentworker/sdk/react`.
  Vue: `@contentworker/sdk/vue`. Edge functions: `createEdgeClient` from `@contentworker/sdk/edge`.
- Rich text is a document tree, never HTML: render it with `toHtml` / `toMarkdown` from
  `@contentworker/sdk/rich-text` (escaped, safe links, `entryHref` and `renderEntry` hooks).

Filters, ordering and every parameter: https://docs.contentworker.app/guides/reading-content/

## Write, and read your own writes

```ts
import { createManagementClient } from '@contentworker/sdk/management';

const cma = createManagementClient({ baseUrl: 'https://api.your-workspace.contentworker.app', space: 'your-space', environment: 'main', token: process.env.CONTENTWORKER_CMA_TOKEN! });
const { entry } = await cma.entries.create({ contentTypeApiId: 'article', fields: { title: { 'en-US': 'Hello' } } });
await cma.entries.publish(entry.id, { expectedVersion: entry.currentVersion });
```

- Field values are keyed by field, then locale: `{ title: { 'en-US': 'Hello' } }`, even for a
  field that isn't localized (it uses the default locale).
- `cma.entries.update(id, fields)` saves the whole draft: send every field, or read it first.
- Pass `expectedVersion` to `publish`: if someone saved since you read, it's a 409 and nothing
  publishes.
- Errors throw `ManagementError`; narrow with `isValidationError`, `isConflict`, `isNotFound`,
  `isRateLimited`.
- **Read-your-writes.** A read right after a write may hit a lagging read replica. The Management
  client and a preview client echo the `x-cw-bookmark` header for you. To hand a write's freshness
  to another client (a server action to the browser's preview client), pass `cma.bookmark` as that
  client's `bookmark` option. Delivery never takes one: it is cached and catches up shortly after
  a publish.

## Type against the model

Generate types from the live model, then type reads with them:

```sh
contentworker types --out src/generated/content-types.ts
```

```ts
import type { ArticleFields } from './generated/content-types';
const article = await client.getEntry<ArticleFields>(id, { locale: 'en-US' });
```

Each type gets a delivery shape (`ArticleFields`) and a management shape (`ArticleDraftFields`).
Regenerate in CI after the model changes (the `content_type.published` webhook fires on publish).
`contentworker types` and `GET …/content-types?format=typescript` give the same output, except
that `contentworker types` takes the block types (`BlockTypes`) from the block catalog once one is
pushed.

## Render blocks

Render a blocks field with `<Blocks value components catalog />` from `@contentworker/sdk/react`
(`<CwBlocks>` from `@contentworker/sdk/vue`, `renderBlocks` from `@contentworker/sdk/blocks`
elsewhere), typing `components` as `BlockComponents<BlockTypes>`. Pass the catalog so a block
stored under a former id renders as its block, a `fallback` for ids your code doesn't know yet,
and `preview` only in a live preview render.

## Render rich text

A `RichText` field is a `RichTextDocument`: `{ nodeType: 'document', content: [...] }`. Render it
by switching on `nodeType`, and render unknown types as nothing rather than failing. Never store or
send HTML back; the API refuses anything but the node vocabulary. See
[references/rendering-rich-text.md](references/rendering-rich-text.md) for every node type, a
renderer and how to treat embeds (`embedCard` from `@contentworker/sdk` gives a safe link card).

## Caching

- Delivery responses are fresh for a minute, purged on publish, unpublish or an alias change, and
  carry an `ETag`. Don't add a long cache of your own in front.
- Static sites: rebuild on the `entry.published` webhook, or fetch only what changed with
  `since=`. Live pages: `GET /delivery/{space}/{env}/live` streams publish events.
- `cacheTtlMs` on a Delivery client adds a short in-memory cache per process.
- Point production at an environment alias (`/delivery/acme/production`) so promoting a new
  environment needs no deploy.

## Check your setup

```sh
contentworker login --url https://api.your-workspace.contentworker.app
contentworker doctor
contentworker whoami --json
```

`doctor` checks sign-in, reachability, the API version and access to the space. In CI set
`CONTENTWORKER_TOKEN` and `CONTENTWORKER_URL` instead of logging in.
