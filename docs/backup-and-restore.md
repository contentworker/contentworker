# Backup, restore & disaster recovery

What holds state, what is derivable, and how to recover a deployment.

Editorial runs have their records in the database (`workflow_runs`), but the instance holds the execution and is not rebuilt from it |

Everything else (worker code, `wrangler.jsonc` templates, the fleet registry, migrations) is
in git (the registry in the private fleet repo). Secrets live in each deployment's GitHub environment; `DATA_KEY`, `TOKEN_PEPPER` and
`PASSWORD_PEPPER` must be escrowed, because losing one makes what it protects unreadable
(sealed secrets, API key hashes, password hashes). See [Escrowing secrets](#escrowing-secrets).

## Point-in-time recovery

The database keeps a point-in-time history (the retention window depends on the plan).
Before each migration, the deploy job records a restore point:

```sh
wrangler d1 time-travel info DB --json --config wrangler.<id>.json   # → .bookmark
```

`wrangler.<id>.json` is the engine's rendered config (`node scripts/fleet.ts render <id>` writes
`apps/engine/wrangler.<id>.json`, see [Deployment](./deployment.md)). Run the `wrangler` commands
on this page inside `apps/engine`, or from the repo root as
`pnpm --filter @contentworker/engine exec wrangler …` (as CI does), so `--config` resolves.

The bookmark is written to the run's step summary and as a notice (`D1 bookmark for <id> before
this deploy`). A migration cannot be rolled back, but the database can be restored to that
bookmark.

## Environment snapshots

`GET …/export` produces portable JSON for one environment, `POST …/import` replays it, and
`POST …/clone` does both, including across spaces (`packages/application/src/snapshots.ts`).
Import and clone write the content model (and the asset folders) in the request and the entries
and assets as bulk jobs
(`snapshot-jobs.ts`); follow them at `…/bulk/jobs/:id`.
Import replays domain operations (`createEntry`, `publishEntry`, …) rather than inserting rows,
so validation, references, read models, the outbox and the search index end up as they would
organically. A snapshot carries **no credentials and no asset bytes**; see the
[API reference](./environments-and-snapshots.md). Use snapshots to copy content
between environments or spaces, or to keep an off-platform copy of content; use point-in-time
recovery to recover the database. The same operations are MCP tools (`environment_export`,
`environment_import`, `environment_clone`).

**Deleting an environment is irreversible.** `DELETE /spaces/:space/environments/:env?confirm=` (and the
`environment_delete` MCP tool) needs `confirm` to repeat the environment id and refuses `main` and
any environment an alias points at (409). Deleting removes the environment from the registry at
once, then purges its rows in bounded steps and deletes its object storage files under
`<space>/<environment>/` (`packages/application/src/environment-purge.ts`). Point-in-time
recovery can restore the rows but not the bytes. An `environment_export` taken first keeps the
content model, entries and taxonomy, but a snapshot carries no asset bytes either.

## Replaying events from the outbox

The relay sets `relayed_at` (epoch milliseconds) when it enqueues an event, and relayed rows are
kept for `EVENT_RETENTION_HOURS` (default 168). If events may have been lost around an
incident (a dead-lettered batch, a restored database whose queue state no longer matches),
mark them pending again. Run this by hand only through a reviewed change or an incident
procedure; never migrate or edit a remote database from an agent session.

```sql
-- Re-relay everything enqueued in the last hour (consumers are idempotent on the event id).
UPDATE outbox SET relayed_at = NULL
WHERE relayed_at > (unixepoch('subsec') * 1000) - 3600000;
```

The next mutating request's nudge, or the cron sweep within a minute, picks the rows up. For
search staleness alone, `POST …/search/reindex` rebuilds the index without touching the event
pipeline.

## Restore procedure

1. Find the bookmark: the deploy run's summary for a bad migration, or
   `wrangler d1 time-travel info DB --timestamp <unix or RFC3339> --config wrangler.<id>.json`
   for a point in time.
2. Restore the database: `wrangler d1 time-travel restore DB --bookmark <bookmark> --config wrangler.<id>.json`.
   The restore itself returns a bookmark from just before it, so it can be undone.
3. If the restored schema is older than the deployed code expects, roll the workers back (CI's
   rollback order: engine, api, delivery, web) or fix forward with an expand-only migration.
   New code may read columns the restored schema does not have yet. The engine cannot be rolled
   back past a stateful-object migration (the platform refuses); CI then leaves the other workers
   on the new version to match it and fails for a person to decide
   (`scripts/deploy.sh`), so fix forward.
4. Asset bytes in object storage are not rolled back with the database. Rows that reference
   objects created after the restore point are gone; objects deleted after it are not restored.
   That includes the files of a deleted environment: the purge deletes them from object storage,
   so restoring the environment's rows leaves assets that point at bytes that no longer exist.
5. Archived version bodies in object storage are not rolled back either. They are deleted only
   with their entry (deleting it for good from the trash) or their environment (a purge). A
   restore to before a version was archived simply finds its body back in the database. A restore
   that brings back an entry or environment deleted since brings back version rows whose archived
   bodies are gone: their history lists mark those versions unavailable, while the entries
   themselves read correctly.
6. Rebuild derived indexes: `POST …/search/reindex` per space and environment (queued, in
   bounded slices).
7. Replay events from the outbox for the incident window if downstream systems may have missed
   them.

## Escrowing secrets

GitHub and Cloudflare both hold secrets write-only, so nobody needs to have seen a value to escrow
it: the `Escrow secrets` workflow reads them inside the deployment's GitHub environment and encrypts
them to a key only the escrow holder has. Nothing from the repository runs beside the secrets, and
the job fails if a required secret or `PASSWORD_PEPPER` is missing. It reaches only what the
environment holds: a secret set by hand on a Worker is not escrowed.

The workflow must be in the repository that holds the environment, and only a branch the
environment allows can read it (`provision.sh` limits each to `main`). Prefer a private repository:
there the artifact and the environment's name aren't public.

**Once, make the key** on the holder's machine, outside any checkout. Put the private half in a
password manager outside GitHub and Cloudflare, delete the file, and pin the public half as
`ESCROW_RECIPIENT` in `.github/workflows/escrow-secrets.yml`, through a pull request:

```sh
age-keygen -o ~/escrow.key     # prints the public key (age1...)
```

**After provisioning and after any change to a secret,** run it from `main`, then check where the
file came from before keeping it. Anyone can encrypt to a public key, so a file that opens isn't
proof: the run must be this workflow, on `main`, and a success.

```sh
gh workflow run escrow-secrets.yml --ref main -f environment=production
gh run view <run-id> --json workflowName,headBranch,event,conclusion
gh run download <run-id> --name escrow-production
age --decrypt --identity ~/escrow.key escrow.age | cut -d= -f1    # names only
gh api --method DELETE repos/<owner>/<repo>/actions/artifacts/<artifact-id>
```

The artifact is ciphertext, but this repository's artifacts are public, so delete it as soon as it
is down; it expires after a day regardless. Keep every generation, named with its date and run id,
for at least the database's recovery window: a restore to before a `DATA_KEY` rotation brings back
values sealed under the old key. During a rotation, run it before removing `DATA_KEY_PREVIOUS`.

**To recover,** set each value back on the environment. Values can contain `=`, so split on the first
one only:

```sh
age --decrypt --identity ~/escrow.key escrow.age | while IFS= read -r line; do
  printf %s "${line#*=}" | gh secret set "${line%%=*}" --env production
done
```

Losing the private key loses the escrow, not the deployment: make a new key and run the workflow
again while the environment still holds the values. If the private key leaks, make a new one and
rotate what can rotate (`DATA_KEY`, `PRINCIPAL_KEY`, `MEDIA_SIGNING_SECRET`). `TOKEN_PEPPER` and
`PASSWORD_PEPPER` can't rotate, so treat them as exposed: hashes alone still need the database too.

## Recovery objectives

The targets each store is held to. **RPO** is how much recent data a recovery may lose; **RTO** is
how long the recovery may take. "Met" says whether the target can be reached today.
