# Configuration

Every setting is a platform binding, a `vars` entry in an app's `wrangler.jsonc`, or a secret.
Vars and bindings are typed in `packages/platform/src/env.ts` (`EdgeEnv`, used by the api,
delivery and engine workers) and parsed in `packages/platform/src/config.ts` (`loadConfig`).
The web worker's own settings are read in `apps/web/app/lib/*.server.ts`. Per-deployment values
(names, ids, routes, `OAUTH_ISSUER`, `MEDIA_BASE_URL`, `MEDIA_PUBLIC_URL`, `AI_GATEWAY_ID`, SSO,
email) are filled in by `scripts/fleet.ts render`; see [Deployment](./deployment.md).

**Worker** columns below: **W** web, **A** api, **D** delivery, **E** engine; the media worker
has its own section, [Media worker](#media-worker). "Template" means the var is set in that
worker's committed `wrangler.jsonc`; a var not listed there falls back to its code default.

## Adapter selection

Every binding is optional. An absent binding selects a dev fallback, and on a **persistent**
deployment (one with `DB` bound) the fail-closed guard (`assertNoFakeAdapters`) refuses to boot
behind a fake unless `ALLOW_FAKE_ADAPTERS` names it.

Keys are at least 32 characters (`openssl rand -hex 32`); `scripts/fleet.ts` refuses shorter
ones at deploy.

## Admin sign-in (web worker)

| ------------------ | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `OIDC_ISSUER`      | empty   | OpenID Connect issuer. With `OIDC_CLIENT_ID` and `OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET`, the sign-in page offers single sign-on; admins set the rest on Team |
| `OIDC_CLIENT_ID`   | empty   | Client id the provider issued                                                                                                              |

Rendered from the registry's `sso` field. Passwords, passkeys, TOTP and SCIM need no vars.
Password reset by email needs the `EMAIL` binding with `EMAIL_FROM` and `EMAIL_FROM_NAME`
(empty by default), rendered from the registry's `email` field like the engine's. As on the
engine, a bound `EMAIL` without `EMAIL_FROM` is a configuration error: the web worker throws
rather than treating the deployment as sending no email.

## API keys and seeding (api, engine)

## Rate limits

| ----------------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `RATE_LIMIT_READ_PER_WINDOW`  | `0` (off) | > 0 mounts the request-rate middleware on the api (the native bindings then enforce their own limits)                                |
| `RATE_LIMIT_WRITE_PER_WINDOW` | `0` (off) | Same, for mutations                                                                                                                  |
| `RATE_LIMIT_AI_PER_WINDOW`    | `0` (off) | Same, for model and embeddings calls (`entries/generate`, moderation, translation, alt text, AI actions, search)                     |
| `RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_SECONDS`   | `60`      | Window, also the `Retry-After` value                                                                                                 |
| `AUTH_RATE_LIMIT_MAX`         | `10`      | Failed authentications per client IP per window before 429. Read by `RateLimiterDO` from the **engine's** env (the class runs there) |
| `AUTH_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS`   | `60000`   | Failed-auth window, read the same way                                                                                                |

The api's request-rate middleware mounts only when at least one `RATE_LIMIT_*_PER_WINDOW` var is
above 0. The `RATE_LIMIT_READ`, `_WRITE` and `_AI` bindings in `apps/api/wrangler.jsonc` (600, 120
and 20 per 60 s) then enforce the limits; with all three vars at 0 the bindings are never
consulted. No committed `wrangler.jsonc`, and no registry entry the maintainers keep, sets any of the vars, so the api
applies no per-client request limit by default; set them to turn it on. The native bindings are per
edge location and approximate. The delivery gateway is different: it always applies
`RATE_LIMIT_READ` by client IP. The web worker's `API_LIMIT` binding covers the sign-in paths that
need no session and SCIM.

| `MEDIA_SIGNING_SECRET`          | Its only secret: verifies published paths' tokens and signed `/media/*` GETs (with `exp`), the share-link tokens, and signs a share link's unlock cookie. Required with `DB` bound; dev uses the dev key, as the api does |

Its `exports` put the edge cache on the `Media` entrypoint only; the default (gateway) entrypoint
is uncached.

The delivery worker's HTTP cache headers (`public, max-age=60, stale-while-revalidate=86400,
stale-if-error=604800`) are fixed in `apps/delivery/src/delivery.ts`, not configurable.

## Local development values

`pnpm dev` runs the api, engine, media and delivery as auxiliary workers of the web app's Vite
session and overrides their vars with `LOCAL_STACK_VARS` (`apps/web/vite.config.ts`).
`MEDIA_PUBLIC_URL` is left empty: the media worker runs (it consumes its purge queue) but isn't
routable from the browser, so delivered assets keep the api's signed URLs locally. The values,
the seed settings and how to reset them are in [Development](./development.md#running-locally).
