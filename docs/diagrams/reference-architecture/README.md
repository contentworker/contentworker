# Reference architecture diagrams

Mermaid sources for [Reference architecture](../../reference-architecture.md), each with the SVG
rendered from it. The page holds the prose: every numbered callout (①, ②, …) and what each
diagram leaves out. Each source carries an `accTitle` and an `accDescr`, the paragraph a reader
gets if the image fails to load.

| File                     | Type            | Detail   | Labeled nodes |
| ------------------------ | --------------- | -------- | ------------- |
| `overview.mmd`           | flowchart       | faithful | 22 of 24      |
| `publish-to-deliver.mmd` | sequenceDiagram | balanced | 11 of 12      |
| `delivery-read.mmd`      | flowchart       | balanced | 11 of 12      |
| `asset-pipeline.mmd`     | flowchart       | balanced | 12 of 12      |

Change a source and its SVG in the same commit, and the page's callout text if a callout moved.

## Checking and rendering

```sh
# needs the marmalade Claude Code plugin (scripts) and Node (mermaid-cli)
P=~/.claude/plugins/cache/marmalade/marmalade/0.1.3/scripts
python3 $P/marmalade_lint.py docs/diagrams/reference-architecture
python3 $P/marmalade_slop.py docs/diagrams/reference-architecture/overview.mmd --detail faithful
python3 $P/marmalade_slop.py docs/diagrams/reference-architecture/{publish-to-deliver,delivery-read,asset-pipeline}.mmd --detail balanced
npx @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli -i overview.mmd -o overview.svg -c $P/../assets/themes/light.json
```

The rubric scores `publish-to-deliver.mmd` 82 with one SLOP001, and that finding is a counting
artifact, not a real overage. The slop checker's node counter is written for flowcharts. It
counts each sequence arrow's source as an extra id (`Api-` from `Api->>`, `Api--` from
`Api-->>`) and the `rgb(` of the focal `rect` as a node. Its own vetted `sequence.mmd` template,
which has three participants, counts as 7 nodes. The diagram has 11 participants against a budget
of 12.

`title`, `accTitle` and `accDescr` write `{domain}` rather than `<domain>`. Mermaid renders those
fields as text, so an HTML entity shows up literally and a raw `<domain>` is dropped as a tag.
