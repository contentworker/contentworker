/**
 * Who created the entry and who changed it last, at the top of the editor's details, in a card of
 * its own that never folds away: two lines are cheaper to read than a toggle. A writer reads as a
 * teammate's name, "You", or the kind of writer it was (an agent, a workflow, an API key), never
 * as an id; long names wrap rather than clip. An entry from before authorship was recorded says
 * so rather than guessing.
