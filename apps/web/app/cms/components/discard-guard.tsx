 * asks in place of the form's buttons. A successful save closes through the caller's own
 * `onOpenChange`, which doesn't ask.
 *
 * During a save there is no question to ask: it has been sent, and "Nothing has been saved" would
 * be untrue. The form holds, {@link GuardCancel} is disabled, and a try at leaving says so. Only a
 * save holds it: a read (a dry run, a fetch to inspect) stays closable, so leave it out of `saving`.
 *
 * After a save fails the form lets go, and what the question may say depends on how it failed: a
 * refusal saved nothing, anything else may have landed. The form hands the error to `saveFailed`,
 * and from then until it closes {@link DiscardAsk} says so in place of any note.
