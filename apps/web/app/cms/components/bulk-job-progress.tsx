/**
 * A bulk action running as a job on the server, whatever it acts on: batches, not items, because
 * batches are what complete (a count that moved a chunk at a time would look stuck between
 * jumps), in the upload queue's Progress bar, with the reassurance that it keeps going if the tab
 * closes. A job that ended with failures is stamped as waiting on a person, never as done. The
 * summary line is a polite live region, so its end is heard. What failed is named beside it, by
 * the screen's failures Alert, once the report is read.
 *
 * A running job can be stopped (confirmed in place). A stop is a stop to new batches, not a
 * rollback: batches done stay done, and one under way when it came may still finish, so the card
 * says how far it had got and that the screen shows what changed (it reloads as the job ends).
 * When the job ends, focus that was on its Stop (now gone) moves to Dismiss.
