/**
 * The assistant's state, shared by the shell and the pages under it: whether the panel is open,
 * what the page in front of it is about (the context chip), and the edits pages hand it. The panel
 * lives in the shell, so a conversation and a card waiting for an answer survive navigation.
 *
 * A page's edit goes through the assistant (`act`): the exact MCP tool call for what was pressed,
 * no model, kept in the conversation. An action stops at a confirm card in the panel and the page
 * waits for the answer; anything else runs at once and leaves a line. When the assistant can't be
 * reached (switched off, or its socket down), `useAssistantEdit` says so with `null` and the page
 * makes the edit through the API itself, as it always did: an edit never depends on the panel.
