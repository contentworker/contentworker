/**
 * How the panel talks to the person's AssistantAgent (`@contentworker/http/assistant`, hosted by
 * the engine): the agent's address, the body every chat request carries, and the two calls a page's
 * edit makes. Kept in one place so the wire can change without touching the panel or the pages.
 *
 * - `act(tool, input, context, about?)`: one exact MCP tool call, no model. A tool with `confirm`
 *   answers `{ callId, waiting: true }` and shows a card in the conversation (a `tool-<name>` part in
 *   `approval-requested`, `toolMetadata: { direct: true, about }`); anything else runs at once and
 *   answers `{ callId, output }`, leaving a line. A refusal rejects with the words to show.
 * - `resolve(callId, approved)`: answers a card `act` made. Cards the model proposes are answered
 *   with the AI SDK's own tool-approval response instead (`addToolApprovalResponse`).
