/**
 * Ending what a person can still reach in the admin, in one place: their sessions and their

 * SCIM deactivating them each end the parts that no longer fit, so a credential made under the old
 * trust doesn't outlive it.
 *
 * `tokens` also ends the credentials the api holds for them (OAuth grants and their tokens,
 * personal access tokens, setup credentials, in every space), through the api's
 * `DELETE /deployment/people/:subject/credentials`, signed as this Worker acting for the
 * deployment. A failure there throws, so the action fails visibly and can be repeated (both
