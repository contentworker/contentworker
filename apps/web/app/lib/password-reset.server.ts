/**
 * Self-service password reset: someone who forgot their password asks for a code by email, then
 * sets a new password with it (the pages are `routes/login-forgot.tsx` and `routes/login-reset.tsx`;
 * the code's shape and the copy are `password-reset.ts`).
 *
 * - Nothing the browser sees says whether an address has an account. Asking for a code always
 *   gets the same answer (`resetSent`) after the same work: the request is counted against the
 *   address and the place (`reset-email`, `reset-ip`), and everything that depends on the account
 *   (looking it up, writing the code, sending the email, the audit entry) runs after the response.
 *   A code that doesn't work always reads the same (`RESET_CODE_INVALID`, `RESET_LINK_INVALID`)
 *   after the same work: two counter upserts and one read, and the hashing, whether or not a code
 *   is live. The audit log says why.
 * - Every limit here counts each attempt with one atomic upsert and decides on the count the
 *   write returned (`countAttempt`, `overFor`), so a burst of parallel requests can't slip past.
 * - The per-address cap is a hard ceiling, whoever asks: someone who knows only an address can use
 *   up its 3 codes for the window, and the owner's own requests in that window then send nothing.
 *   They get none of the codes, though, and each new code replaces the last; the owner waits out
 *   the window or asks an admin.
 * - Codes go only to an enabled account with a password, while the workspace isn't SSO-only.
 *   Someone single sign-on added (no password) gets none: a reset would give them a password their
 *   identity provider doesn't control. With SSO-only on, there is nothing to reset.
 * - Only an HMAC of the code (with `PASSWORD_PEPPER`) is stored (`password_resets`). It works
 *   once, for 15 minutes and `RESET_TRIES` tries; a new code for the person deletes their older
 *   ones. A typed code is tried only from the browser that asked for it (the nonce in its cookie,
 *   stored hashed with the code), so a stranger can't spend the owner's tries; the emailed link
 *   works anywhere and its tries are counted by the reset's id. Tries are also limited per place
 *   (`reset-code-ip`).
 * - Setting the password keeps the policy (`passwordProblem`), ends every session and pending
 *   two-factor challenge in the same database batch, and starts no session: the person signs in
 *   with the new password, and then with their two-factor code if they use one. Passkeys,
 *   two-factor sign-in and API tokens are left as they are: an emailed code proves only the
 *   mailbox, so it may replace the password and nothing else.
