/**
 * The API gateway: the web Worker fronts the api Worker over the `API` service binding, so the
 * admin, the REST and GraphQL APIs, MCP, OAuth and the docs share one origin.
 *
 * Credentials never cross the binding as the browser sent them:
 * 1. A request with `Authorization: Bearer …` (an API key, a personal access token, an OAuth
 *    token) goes through as it is; the api authenticates it. Only a caller-supplied
 *    `x-cw-principal` is removed, so a bearer request can never carry a principal.
 * 2. Otherwise, a request from this origin with a live web session has its cookies removed and a
 *    signed `x-cw-principal` added (`@contentworker/security`), good for 60 seconds and for that
 *    path only. A cross-site request never gets one, so a page elsewhere can't borrow the session.
 * 3. Otherwise it goes through with no credentials at all, and the api answers 401 where it needs
 *    one.
 *
 * `x-cw-bookmark` (read-your-writes) passes through both ways untouched. A WebSocket upgrade
 * (the assistant's socket, `/agents/…`) goes the same way: the binding carries the upgrade and
 * hands back the api's socket.
